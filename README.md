# guacamole

## Initial Idea

A universal homepage/start-page that supports multiple users. The main goals:
* Ad-free
* Clean, distraction-free design
* Adapts to the user's interests and goals
* Designed to help the user with those goals

#### Concept

When we explore a large space without a goal in mind, we are succeptible to suggestion and visual cues that change our behavior. For instance, all else being equal, if we encounter two doors side by side, we're more likely to choose the one on the right.

The goal of "guacamole" is to remind you of your goals and strip away the visual cues that change your behavior. When you startup your browser, this distraction-free page will help you see your goals and act on them.

#### Initial brainstorming

As a user, I want to have control over what is on my page.

As a user, I want to be able to share my homepage with my friends

What do you want the first place you arrive online to be?

Visual cues change our behavior. Given two doors, most people are more likely to choose the one on the right. Given too many choices, most people feel paralyzed. Gates helps you create a gateway to the web that’s more usable and helpful to you. Your gate is what you want it to be.

gates operates on minimal design principles. we believe a clean house can help make a clean mind, so every user’s gate starts as a blank page. 

gates also operates with a purpose - to help you grow. think of us as a fiduciary for your investment on the web. or like a doctor with a commitment to you, your health (and your complete privacy).

Start by writing out some of your goals. We recommend you stay pretty general for now. After you’ve written a goal, press enter to submit it. When you’re done, press escape to conclude.

This is your interest bank. You can come back here and add more goals later, but for now, we just want you to know that this is an important feature of gates. Come back here later to see other features of the bank.

We recognized a few of these. You mentioned Guitar. Is music one of your interests?

Websites, like retail stores, are designed to sell you services. Every home page, like a store entrance, is designed to convert you from a browser into a buyer. We don’t do that.

Our site is a mirror of your making that reflects your wants, motivations and goals. We’re helping you make the web what you want it to be.

You want to improve as a musician. This is your gateway to that goal.

Humans like lists and finite collections. We have a hard time thinking about large goals and large pieces all at once. Music gates helps you break those goals and pieces up into smaller achievable steps.

The important thing is to take advantage of every rest cycle you have. Play a little bit every day, and your mind’s natural rewiring during sleep will help you grow each day.

Playing (25 minutes)
We learn to play piano in small steps, one tough section at a time. As you play through your practice pieces and studies, try to recognize the tough sections and measures that are giving you trouble. When you get to one of these sections, make a mental note of it, and practice it five times in a row, or until you feel comfortable. Once you’re ready to move on, play through to the next trouble section and repeat the process.
