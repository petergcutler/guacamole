# guacamole

#### idea

A universal homepage/start-page that supports multiple users. The main goals:
* Ad-free
* Clean, distraction-free design
* Adapts to the user's interests and goals
* Designed to help the user with those goals


#### concept

When we explore a large space without a goal in mind, we are susceptible to suggestion and visual cues that change our behavior. For instance, all else being equal, if we encounter two doors side by side, we're more likely to choose the one on the right.

The goal of "guacamole" is to remind you of your goals and strip away the visual cues that change your behavior. When you startup your browser, this distraction-free page will help you see your goals and act on them.
